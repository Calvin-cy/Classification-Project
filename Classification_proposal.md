# Classification Project Proposal
## Question/need
- The purpose of this project is to determine whether an individual will subscribe for term deposit
- The banks will be beneficial from exploring this model

## Data Description 
- Bank Marketing Dataset From kaggle
- 17 columns 
- 11162 rows
- An individual unit of analysis consists of the identities of an individual like age, job, marital status and so on
- Expecting to work with categorical, numerical features and binary features
- The target variable will be the deposit column of the dataset

## Tools
- Python (Jupyter Nobebook)
- Pandas and Numpy : Examine the data and Clean the data
- Sklearn to create regression models
- Matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the data

## MVP 
- Finding the best feature that can explain well on why an individual subscribes term deposit
